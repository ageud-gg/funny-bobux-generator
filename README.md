# funny-bobux-generator
Update notes:
- New FE script "Gale Fighter"
- Net bypass button for big servers
- New gui

**NOTE: THE NEW GUI WILL PROBABLY NOT WORK FOR MOBILE**

new gui loadstring:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageud-gg/funny-bobux-generator/main/main.lua"))()
```

old gui:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageud-gg/funny-bobux-generator/main/reanim%20gui.lua"))()
```

and it should work
